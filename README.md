## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (preprocessor css) [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Scrollrevealjs (animation library) [https://scrollrevealjs.org/]
- BEM syntax

### What I learned

In this challenge I practiced managing a multi-page site, and at the same time I had to manage several interactive components such as an **accordion** and a **dialog**. All this helped me to be able to control different aspects, taking into account many **variables** that are not always easy.

### Continued development

I will continue with the creation of sites (**better if multi-page**) in order to be better prepared to manage larger and **more complex** projects.

### Useful resources

I found the use of the **Scrollreveal** Javascript library useful and above all very simple, which allowed me to give an extra touch in the management of animations to the scrolling of the various sections of the pages. **I absolutely recommend it**.
